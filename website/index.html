			<p>Hi, My name is Conner.</p>
			<p>	
				Prior to gSchool, I was a Computer/Network technician. I did a lot of administration for systems, networks, and some general help desk for large businesses.
				I did feel like this work was enjoyable, but I also felt limited in terms of personal growth, so I decided to move onto coding!
			</p>
			<p>
				I've been interested in computers since I was a kid. When I was 8 years old, I found my first computer sitting next to the trash outside of someones house. It was broken originally. Luckily, when I opened it up I found a cable that came loose on the inside. I plugged it into the only place it would fit to see if it worked. It did.
				This sparked my interest in problem solving and computers in general.
