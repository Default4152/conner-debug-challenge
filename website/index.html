			<p>Hi, My name is Conner.</p>
			<p>	
				Prior to gSchool, I was a Computer/Network technician. I did a lot of administration for systems, networks, and some general help desk for large businesses.
				I did feel like this work was enjoyable, but I also felt limited in terms of personal growth, so I decided to move onto coding!
			</p>
			<p>
				I've been interested in computers since I was a kid. When I was 8 years old, I found my first computer sitting next to the trash outside of someones house. It was broken originally. Luckily, when I opened it up I found a cable that came loose on the inside. I plugged it into the only place it would fit to see if it worked. It did.
				This sparked my interest in problem solving and computers in general.
			</p>

			<p>I have a lot of goals for myself. Being here, the biggest one is to develop the ability to be better at programming in general, and do my best to keep up with technology.</p>
			<p>I believe that being able to code is an essential skill, so why not become really good at it? I feel like the current approach to applications is based around the web, so this is why I am at gSchool.</p>

			<p>After gSchool, I would love to work at a company that provides cloud computing to it's customers, such as SalesForce.</p>
